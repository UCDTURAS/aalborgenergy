# Aalborg Energy Emissions

Design Intent

TURAS has helped to develop a Heat Mapping Application for Aalborg. This web map will help citizens and municipalities understand energy demands in Aalborg and plan for better energy saving. This is a web-map that illustrates data on material and energy use in cities. The goal is to provide an intuitive way of understanding this complex problem using an interactive interface. We have analysed data across the Aalborg area and generated energy intensities.


Principal Elements

The analysis is based on the energy consumption of a building against the area of each parcel, the application generates a density visualisation to present low to high consumption.
1. Users can zoom in and out on basemap from city level down to building level (to better interrogate data)
2. Users are encouraged to share and disseminate this data. This is done by clicking on the icon in the top right corner of the map box. Allows the users to share map via social media or embed the application on their owns websites or blogs with no coding experience required.
3. Users can see precise measurements for specific parcels by hovering over/or clicking on each parcel.
4. Users can toggle on/off layers from the panel ‘visible layers’ relating to
a. Demand Saving (Mwh/Year
b. Current Demand (Mwh/Year)
c. Heat Density (Current) (Kwh/M2)
d. Heat Density (Saving) (Kwh/M2)
